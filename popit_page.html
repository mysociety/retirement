      <p>PopIt was a <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> project which made it simple to create public, shareable databases of politicians.</p>

        <p>PopIt was created to address the needs of people running Parliamentary websites and apps. Its goal was to save them time and effort by providing a simple, non-technical means by which to make lists of politicians, and keep them up to date.</p>

        <p>Crucially, PopIt converted this data into a structured format that also made it easy for other programmers — and computers — to use the data for further projects. And it was free for anyone to use: like most mySociety projects it was Open Source.</p>

        <p>Above all, PopIt was an attempt to lower the costs and reduce the effort required for building and maintaining democracy, accountability and civic websites and apps.</p>

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>The PopIt project has been superseded by mySociety’s ongoing work with <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>, in which we are helping to set up tools, systems and information that enable and encourage the collection and sharing of structured political data. </p>

        <p>Thanks to Wikidata’s existing worldwide community and widespread usage, we believe that it will more effectively achieve the aims that PopIt was initially developed to take on.</p>

        <p>Wikidata feeds into <a href="http://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician</a>, also a mySociety project and part of our ongoing efforts to provide Civic Tech developers with open, shareable data on politicians everywhere in the world. <a href="http://docs.everypolitician.org/">Find out more</a>.</p>
