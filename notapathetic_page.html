      <p>NotApathetic was a mySociety project, built so that people who were
      planning not to vote in the 2005 UK General Election could tell the world
      why.</p>

        <p>NotApathetic didn’t try to persuade people that voting is a good or
        a bad idea – it was just there to record and share explanations,
        whether ideological, practical or other.

        <p>It aimed to give a voice to the 40% of people who don’t vote, but
        who are not generally given a platform. It also encouraged some
        thoughtful discourse into why some members of society feel unable to
        participate in electoral process – <a href="/">you can still browse the
            archive of 2005 responses here</a>.

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        NotApathetic was one of several democracy sites conceived and run by
        mySociety, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/projects/">many of
            which</a> continue to flourish. It just wasn't possible to give the
        necessary time and resources to all of them, and so we now focus on
        running our core sites and providing support to international
        partners.

        <h2>Would you like to run NotApathetic yourself?</h2>

        <p>We ran it as a one-off project for the 2005 UK general election, but
        we believe a site like NotApathetic would be useful at any election; we
        just don’t have the time to do it again ourselves. If you’re at all
        interested in taking it over and running it, <a
            href="https://www.mysociety.org/contact/">get in touch</a> and
        we’ll tell you what’s involved.</p>
