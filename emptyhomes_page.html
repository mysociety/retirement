      <h1>Looking for {{ page.siteName }}?</h1>
      <p>ReportEmptyHomes was a website created by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> for the <a href="https://www.actiononemptyhomes.org/">Empty Homes Agency</a> where users could report vacant or derelict houses.</p>

  <div class="content__row">
    <div class="content__primary">
      <p>The result was ReportEmptyHomes.com, a site which used the core FixMyStreet codebase, showing how this flexible software can be turned to many issue-mapping uses. Just as with FixMyStreet, the user could place a pin on a map, generating a report that the site would then send to the relevant council.</p>

      <p>In 2011, the site was re-purposed for use alongside <a href="https://www.tigeraspect.co.uk/productions/factual-features/the-great-british-property-scandal/">The Great British Property Scandal</a>, a TV program developed by production agency Tiger Aspect for Channel 4 along with the Empty Homes Agency.</p>

      <p>The project was a success and the programme was <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2013/05/15/mysociety-bafta-and-emmy-nominations/">nominated for and Emmy and a BAFTA</a>.</p>

      <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

      <p>The TV series ran for two seasons and the commercial project came to an end. There are more details on the project in <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/community/case-study-emptyhomes/">this case study</a> on the mySociety website.</p>
