      <p>Keep It In The Community was a <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> project, underpinned by the <a href="https://fixmystreet.org/">FixMyStreet codebase</a>, that collected data places of value to your local community, including Assets of Community Value and assets owned and run by the community.</p>

    <p>Keep It In The Community (also known as KIITC, pronounced ‘Kitsy’) was a project to map Assets of Community Value (ACVs) and community-owned assets across England, and to allow anyone to highlight valued spaces and places that may become ACVs in the future.</p>

    <p>KIITC was created by mySociety in collaboration with <a href="http://www.powertochange.org.uk/">Power To Change</a>, and it had two aims: to create an online record for each ACV and community-owned asset; and to provide an easy way to understand and compare the density, status, and demand for ACVs or community-owned assets in different regions of the country.</p>

    <p>The Plunkett Foundation now manages the data on Community Assets formerly held on Keep It In The Community; helping support their wider campaign for community ownership of assets across the UK. Find out more at <a href="https://www.plunkett.co.uk/">www.plunkett.co.uk</a>.</p>
