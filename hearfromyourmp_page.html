      <p>HearFromYourMP was a mySociety project, running from 2005 to 2015. It
      provided an easy way for constituents to sign up to hear from their MPs,
      and a simple online forum for discussion.</p>

        <p>HearFromYourMP used the power of numbers to encourage MPs to
        communicate with their constituents. If a user entered their details,
        they were added  to a queue of other people in their constituency. When
        enough had signed up, their MP was sent an email saying, “25 of your
        constituents would like to hear what you’re up to. Hit reply to let
        them know”.</p>

        <p>If they didn’t reply, nothing happened, until the MP got a further
        email saying there were now 50, then 75, 100, 150 — until it was
        nonsensical not to reply and start talking.</p>

        <p>The aim was to engage, gently, with those people who have never
        written to a politician before, coaxing them into a slow but personal
        relationship with their representatives.</p>

        <p>And it worked. Over the site’s lifetime, over 230,000 people signed up to receive messages from their MPs, across all 650 UK constituencies.</p>

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>HearFromYourMP was one of several access-to-democracy sites
        conceived and run by mySociety, many of which continue to flourish. In
        2015, with regret, we made the tough decision to turn our focus to
        running our core sites and providing support to international partners.
