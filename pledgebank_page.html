      <p>PledgeBank was a mySociety project, running from 2005 to 2015. It let
      people set up pledges in the form: ‘I will do something, if a certain
      number of people will help me’.</p>

        <p>Thanks to PledgeBank, numerous pledges were fulfilled, from
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200828005149/https://www.pledgebank.com/success#undies">collecting underwear for orphans</a>,
        to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200828005149/https://www.pledgebank.com/success#bakul">donating books to create a town library</a>,
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200828005149/https://www.pledgebank.com/success#SaveTheSycamore">saving a tree from being cut down</a>,
        and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200828005149/https://www.pledgebank.com/success#WIPTintern">funding scholarships</a>.</p>

        <p>PledgeBank was one of the earliest attempts to use the internet to
        gather people together in a common cause, a model which was later used
        to great effect by Groupon, Kickstarter and similar sites.</p>

        <p>Thanks to dedicated volunteers, it was translated into thirteen
        languages, and gained traction in many countries around the world.
        PledgeBank was used for countless good causes, and helped raise funds
        for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200917160437/https://www.pledgebank.com/rights">all</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201022033823/https://www.pledgebank.com/Suriname">kinds</a> of <a

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>PledgeBank was one of several democracy sites conceived and run by
        mySociety, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/projects/">many of
            which</a> continue to flourish. In 2015, with regret, we made the
        tough decision to turn our focus to running our core sites and
        providing support to international partners.
